# SparseMatrixFramework
This project, developed in Java, is based on implementing an efficient data structure for manipulating matrices in which most of the elements are zeros. Instead of using a traditional two-dimensional array, which would waste memory storing all the zeros, a linked-list approach was adopted, where only non-zero elements are stored. The structure follows the traditional linked-list formula with sentinel nodes for each row and column, facilitating the access and manipulation of non-zero elements. Each data node stores the position (row and column) and value of the element, as well as pointers to the next element in the row and column. The program allows the user to perform fundamental operations on matrices, such as: adding two matrices; multiplying a matrix by a scalar; and calculating the transposed matrix. The program's input and output follow a specific model, facilitating integration with other systems or performing automated testing.
